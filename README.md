To implement it, you need to rename the bow to Grimoire\*.  
Works on any version of Minecraft, but requires [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home 'Official site') or [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn 'Mod on the Modrinth website').

\*You can add anything else, the main requirement is that the name contains the word grimoire.
